# Emerging Technologies

The repository contains my 4th year emerging technologies project which consists of 4 jupyter notebook, 1 python script and an images folder.

* Requirements
* Overview
* Code
* Resources and References

## Requirements

### 1. numpy random notebook: 
Ajupyter notebook explaining the conceptsbehindandtheuseofthenumpyrandompackage,includingplots of the various distributions.

### 2. Iris dataset notebook: 
A jupyter notebook explaining the famous iris data set including the diﬃculty in writing an algorithm to separate the three classes of iris based on the variables in the dataset. 

### 3. MNIST dataset notebook: 
A jupyter notebook explaining how to read the MNIST dataset eﬃciently into memory in Python.

### 4. Digit recognition script: 
A Python script that takes an image ﬁle containing a handwritten digit and identiﬁes the digit using a supervised learning algorithm and the MNIST dataset. 

### 5. Digit recognition notebook: 
A jupyternotebook explaining how the above Python script works and discussing its performance.

## Overview

### Anaconda

Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for data science and machine learning applications (large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, scientific computing), that aims to simplify package management and deployment.

To install anaconda visit https://www.anaconda.com/download/ and follow the tutorial. Once that is completed to run these notebooks you will need to install the following packages through anaconda command prompt:  

scit-learn: conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn 

Pillow: conda install -c anaconda pillow

Mathplotlib: conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib 

Keras: conda install -c conda-forge keras 

Tensorflow: conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow 

### Python

Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. In this project I have used python in the jupyter notebooks and a python script developed in visual studio code. It can edited from and text editor. To run the python script navigate to the file directory and open a command prompt and run the command "python digitrec.py".

### Jupyter

Project Jupyter is a nonprofit organization created to "develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages." Spun-off from IPython in 2014 by Fernando Pérez, Project Jupyter supports execution environments in several dozen languages.
